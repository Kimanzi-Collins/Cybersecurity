## Shell Operators

Linux operators give you a level of control for Linux commands.
Examples:

| Symbol/Operator | Description |
| & | This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal. |
| && | This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal. |
| > | This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere. |
| >> | This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten). |
