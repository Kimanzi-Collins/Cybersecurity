# HTML Injection

It is a vulnerability that occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on the page.
A hacker can easily inject a HTML code to a website if the website fails to sanitise user input.

In most cases developers sanitize their code by removing HTML tags from user input when it is being passed as Javascript code.

## In the TryHackMe Lab

I managed to pass a link as part of HTML injection. I used HTML tags when filling the form.

```bash
<a href="http://hacker.com" target="_blank">
```
