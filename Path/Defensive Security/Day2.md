# Day 2- Defensive Security Intro

- ***Also known as blue teaming.***

## Key Areas of Defensive Security

### Monitoring And Detecting

-Continually observing network and system activity to detect suspicious behaviour and events.

### Incident Response

- The team quickly gathers if alerts are raised or suspicious behaviour is detected.

- It involves containing and removing the threat and restoring the system back to normality.

### Threat Intelligence

- Gathering and using information about attackers ie their latest methods, targets and trends.

### Vulnerability Management

- Fixing software flaws as a preventative measure to lower the risk of an attack.

### Investigation and Analysis

- Like solving puzzles, involves separating normal activity from suspicious behaviour.

## Defensive Measures

They include:

- Firewalls
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Encryption
- Access Control
- Security Awareness Training

## Conclusion

- There is a space to do a room in investigating a web vulnerability attack.

- Solution was blocking the attacker's IP address and enforcing rate limits on their IP (Enumeration)

- That marks Day 2. Still trying to find a perfect roadmap that fits best with me.
